      <p id="img-caption">Picture above shows Radia Perlman circa 2009 holding a copy of her book - Interconnections: Bridges, Routers, Switches, and Internetworking Protocols (1999). Perlman's Spanning Tree Protocol allowed for networks with redundancy to be traversed efficiently.</p>

           <h3> Here is a select timeline of Radia's accomplishments:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1969-1976</strong> - Attends MIT. Works part-time with MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's LOGO Lab. Developed TORTIS - an early attempt at making computer programming accessible to children. Graduates with a Master's Degree.</li>
      <li><strong>1980</strong> - Joins Digital Equipment Corportation (DEC.)</li>
      <li><strong>1985</strong> - Publishes <a href="https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/datakom/ht06/slides/sta-perlman.pdf" target="_blank">"An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN"</a> SIGCOMM. Spanning Tree Protocol allowed for the use of more complicated networks without undesirable infinite loops and overwhelming administrative traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>1990</strong> - IEEE publishes the first standard including Spanning Tree Protocol as 802.1D. Additional versions published in 1998 and 2004.</li>
      </ul>

I think that I shall never see<BR>
A graph more lovely than a tree.<BR>
A tree whose crucial property<BR>
Is loop-free connectivity.<BR>
A tree which must be sure to span<BR>
So packets can reach every LAN.<BR>
First the root must be selected.<BR>
By ID it is elected.<BR>
Least cost paths from root are traced.<BR>
In the tree these paths are placed.<BR>
A mesh is made by folks like me<BR>
           Then bridges find a spanning tree.<BR>
